           <div class="flex">
            <p>The term “Coffee” comes from the Latin, Coffea, a member of the Rubiaceae family, including more than 500
                genera and 6000 species of the tropical tree or shrub.
                All coffee is grown within 1000 miles of the equator, from the Tropic of Cancer, to the Tropic of
                Capricorn.
                Coffee is second only to oil as a commodity and second only to water as a beverage.
                Coffee trees take three to four years to mature and bear fruit but they will produce for 20 to 30 years.
                The Japanese bathe in coffee grounds mixed with fermented pineapple pulp to reduce wrinkles and improve
                skin tone. I don’t know….?
                In parts of Africa, coffee beans are soaked in water and spices, and chewed like candy. Yum!
                Storing green coffee is greatly simplified by the fact that insects are naturally repelled by caffeine.
                Maybe we should put caffeine in all of our stored goods!</p>
